### "lazy, slow, stupid, adorable"
## functional language written in python3.6 
This is school project to learn creating own programming language (functional in this case üßê)


```
.__                   __           
|  |__ _____    _____|  | _____.__.
|  |  \__   \  /  ___/  |/ <   |  | | hasky alpha v. 0.0.4
|   Y  \/ __ \_\___ \|    < \___  | | demo version
|___|  (____  /____  >__|_ \/ ____| | 
     \/     \/     \/     \/\/     

every line must end with comma ';'
hasky> print = fn x: x;
hasky> print "hello world";
"hello world"
```






But this is just a prototype concept and some things are not sorted out yet. 
This gave me lot of experience but I have new language in mind so this probably will be no longer updated.
